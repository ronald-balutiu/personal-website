# Test Directory Conventions

- `tests/unit/`: Vitest unit and utility tests.
- `tests/e2e/`: Playwright browser behavior and route smoke tests.
- `tests/a11y/`: Playwright accessibility-focused checks.

Phase 1 scaffolds these folders so future phases can add targeted specs without reorganizing paths.
