highlights:
  - Currently I work on the Native Commerce Ads (NCA) team where I build ad products for creators and publishers. For the creators launch, I developed the personalized recommendations pipeline, partnering closely with data scientists to productionalize a model for ad recommendations at scale. I also optimized keyword search in an existing advertising API by tuning both OpenSearch and DAX clusters and re-architecting clients with asynchronous, thread-safe queries. That work reduced latency by about 90% and improved reliability for high-volume ad-serving flows.
  - Previously on Amazon Payments, I spearheaded the engineering delivery for Seller Wallet's Third-Party Payments expansion in Europe, coordinating product, security, compliance, and payments stakeholders across regions. For the U.S. Third-Party Payments launch, I defined and delivered core onboarding, screening, enforcement, and UI workflows, including a real-time enforcement mechanism to freeze funds in accordance with U.S. regulations. Additionally, for this launch, I modernized a critical Payments Security backend by strengthening cryptographic functions and removing insecure components affecting downstream services. Early in my career I established Seller Wallet's UI using micro-frontends, kicking off my career as a full-stack engineer.
