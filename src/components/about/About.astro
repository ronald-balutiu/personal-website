    <p class="about-text">
      I’m currently a New York-based SDE II at Amazon on the Native Commerce Ads (NCA) team,
      building scalable systems that support millions of daily customers. I care deeply about clear,
      accessible user experiences where complex and critical workflows become reliable and intuitive
      to use.

      My work spans backend systems, platform engineering, and end-to-end product flows. Within this
      scope, I’ve designed shared UI infrastructure and built backend services for key ad and
      payment workflows. I also led the EU launch of a Third Party Payments feature across seven
      marketplaces, coordinating engineers across multiple time zones to expand Seller Wallet
      internationally.

      Outside of work I enjoy skiing, photography, and exploring the city I grew up in and still
      find endlessly interesting.
