    <p class="about-text">
      I’m currently a New York-based software engineer at <strong>Amazon Ads</strong>, building
      scalable systems that support millions of daily customers. I care deeply about clear,
      accessible user experiences where complex and critical workflows become reliable and intuitive
      to use.

      My passion for engineering started during undergrad at the <strong
        >University of Chicago</strong
      > with my first computer science course. After finishing internships in real estate and private
      equity, I realized those paths weren’t a great fit and was drawn instead to technology for its constant
      change and room to explore. That shift led to a role at the school's <strong
        >Computer Science Instructional Library</strong
      >
      and later an internship at <strong>Visa</strong> in Client Engineering, which helped set the direction
      for the work I do today.

      Outside of work I enjoy skiing, photography, and exploring the city I grew up in and still
      find endlessly interesting.
