    <p class="about-text">
      I’m currently an SDE II at Amazon on the Native Commerce Ads (NCA) team, building scalable
      systems that support millions of daily ad customers. I care deeply about clear, accessible
      user experiences and enjoy work at the intersection of product design and engineering, where
      complex and high-stakes workflows become reliable and intuitive to use.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      Previously, I was a core contributor to Amazon Payments’ Seller Wallet, growing from a
      founding engineer on the product to a subject matter expert across domains.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      My work spans backend systems, platform engineering, and end-to-end product flows. I’ve
      designed shared UI infrastructure using React and Module Federation, built critical compliance
      and payments workflows, and led the EU expansion of a Third Party Payments feature across
      seven marketplaces, owning delivery end to end while coordinating engineers across multiple
      time zones.

      Outside of work I enjoy skiing and exploring New York, the city I grew up in and still find
      endlessly interesting.
