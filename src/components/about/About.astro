    <p class="about-text">
      I’m a software engineer focused on building clear, accessible user experiences backed by
      scalable, production-grade systems. My favorite work sits at the intersection of product
      design and engineering, where complex and high-stakes workflows become reliable and intuitive
      to use.

    <p class="about-text">
      I’m currently an SDE II at Amazon on the Native Commerce Ads (NCA) team, building systems that
      support millions of daily ad customers. Previously, I was a core contributor to Amazon
      Payments’ Seller Wallet, growing from a founding engineer on the product to a subject matter
      expert across domains.

      My work spans frontend platform engineering and core product flows. I’ve designed shared UI
      infrastructure using React and Module Federation, built seller enforcement workflows, owned
      the end-to-end Third-Party Payments (3PP) onboarding experience, and led the EU expansion of
      3PP across seven marketplaces. This work required close coordination with engineers across
      onboarding, compliance, payments, and accounting to deliver a compliant and scalable launch.

      Outside of work I enjoy skiing and exploring New York, the city I grew up in and still find
      endlessly interesting.
